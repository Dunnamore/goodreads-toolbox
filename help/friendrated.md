**Note:**

You can break the process with <kbd>CTRL</kbd>-<kbd>C</kbd> and continue later
without having to re-read all online sources again, as reading from
Goodreads.com is very time consuming.  The script internally uses a
**file-cache** which is busted after 31 days and saves to /tmp/FileCache/.

"0 read 0 hits" is either an empty shelf or a shelf accessible only to friends
of that person (depends on your login).


## Alternative reports

- most _wished-for_ books among the members you follow: use `--toread` option
- most _hated_ books among the members you follow: use `--hated` option
- there are options (`--help`) to fine-tune the reports, e.g., 
	only include books published in a specific time-range, 
	exclude bestsellers etc.


## Observations and limitations

- long runtime: Goodreads slows down all requests and we have to load a lot of data
- books in the upper value range are usually well-known titles, fiction, classics, no surprises
- female GR members mainly read fiction, tend to give 4 and 5 stars pretty generously, 
  and their networks are female
  - start with harsh program settings: min rating of 5 and rated by min 5 followees
- "common authors" tables can be misleading, at the moment:
  it just counts the frequency of a name but does not take into account
  the aggregated ratings of a member for a specific author, example:
  20 members hate 10 books of an author except 1 book.
  the program would count 20x a love relationship for this author,
  although the books in general of this author are more often hated
