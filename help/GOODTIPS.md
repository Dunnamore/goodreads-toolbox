## Things That Improved My Goodreads.com Experience

- **Group shelves** with a prefix, e.g., _"region-usa"_,
  _"region-..."_. Goodreads sorts shelf lists in alphabetical order.
  Related but scattered shelves impair findability.  
  - I moved shelves that are useful to me alone to the _end_ of the list by prefixing them with "z_" or Unicode 0x3161: ㅡ
  - next to pseudo sub-shelves _"computer-history"_, _"computer-networks"_ 
    and so on I'm using a separate _"computer"_ pseudo super-shelf which 
    contains _all_ books from the sub-shelves 
    (useful for [shelf-intersection](https://www.secondrunreviews.com/2016/03/selecting-multiple-shelves-goodreads.html))

- **Create a "more-urgent" shelf** from unread books

- **Create an "abandoned" shelf** to compensate the missing reading-status. 
  Have the exclusive-checkbox [activated](https://www.goodreads.com/shelf/edit)

- **Track physical book location** with shelves such as _"shelf-kitchen"_ or 
  _"shelf-berlin"_ or _"shelf-office"_ if the amount of books exceeds memory (Future me)

- **Limit the number of shelves** to max. 1 page. 
  Few coarse-grained shelves better than 100+ fine-grained shelves: faster to navigate and more likely to keep up-to-date for every book.
  Anemic shelves also render functions such as "[select multiple shelves](https://www.secondrunreviews.com/2016/03/selecting-multiple-shelves-goodreads.html)" (intersection ∩) useless.
  - avoid shelves that will likely never contain more than 3 books
  - try to minimize difference within a shelf and maximize difference between shelves (similar to cluster analysis)
  - merge strongly overlapping shelves, e.g., _"politics-economy-history"_ or _"software-testing-infosec"_
  - remove shelves only good in theory but never used practically

- **Add unread books to custom shelves too.** This works
  well with Goodreads own _"[select multiple](https://www.secondrunreviews.com/2016/03/selecting-multiple-shelves-goodreads.html)"_ feature beneath your
  shelf list. It's clearer than having hundreds of books in _"want-to-read"_ over time,
  and helps others discovering new books more easily. Pick your next book by intersection ∩, e.g.,
  - _"want-to-read" + "non-fiction" + "lang-german"_
  - _"want-to-read" + "fiction" + "politics"_
  
  ![Intersection](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/Set_intersection.svg/320px-Set_intersection.svg.png)
  
- **Negative shelves**, or [non-shelves](https://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/19369665-reverse-results-on-my-shelf#comment_id_181173145): e.g., _"fiction" + "lang-de" + "non-computing"_ would exclude nerd fiction; also useful for friends who are interested in everything but computers; most common negative shelf is _"non-fiction"_; limit to few but big shelves
  
- **Declutter the library** with cardboxes and GR-shelves labeled
  _"donations"_ and _"resales"_. My city library took 30 books
  after receiving a link to my donations shelf.  Such link may also appear in
  your email signature: "I give away books: ...". 
  PS: There is a "book condition" column (shelf settings: table view, [x] condition).

- **Batch edit** shelf feature ([tutorial](https://www.soobsessedwith.com/2014/01/get-organized-on-goodreads.html))

- **Filter reviews by language** °~~by selecting a book edition in your language and "Filter: this edition" ([described here](https://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/19528032#comment_184069651))~~. See [new filter by language feature](https://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/19545889-filter-reviews-using-language#comment_192500388)

- **Become a Goodreads librarian** by applying 
  [there](https://www.goodreads.com/about/apply_librarian). Quickly
  edit wrong or missing book/author info and add cover images by yourself,
  combine stray book editions (take over reviews etc.)

- [Goodreads Ratings for Amazon](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/goodreads-ratings-for-ama/fkkcefhhadenobhjnngfdahhlodolkjg) – a Chrome-browser extension by Rubén Martínez; 
  also reminds you of GR reviews when you're shopping on Amazon (alternatively, try my
  [Tiny JS Injector](https://github.com/andre-st/chrome-injectjs))

- **Check out users who rate good books**. 
  [This service](https://andre-st.github.io/goodreads/) notifies you of new ratings for specific books.
  Be picky, create a special-purpose shelf with good but rare books, don't submit your whole _"read"_ shelf to this service.

- **Force view settings**, e.g., unify the quasi-random view settings when browsing (other people's)
  shelves, by rewriting Goodreads URLs via Einar Egilsson's 
  [Redirector](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redirector/ocgpenflpmgnfapjedencafcfakcekcd)
  Chrome browser extension (or my [Tiny JS Injector](https://github.com/andre-st/chrome-injectjs)). 
  Once you are familiar with the Redirector user interface, you can simply copy/paste these values 
  into the appropriate fields: 
  ```
  Description: Goodreads Shelves: 100 books per page, sort by user-rating (highest first), covers-view
  Example    : https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/13055874?per_page=20&sort=reviews&view=table&shelf=ㅡxx-xx&page=2
  Pattern    : (https://www\.goodreads\.com/review/list/[^?]+)(?=(?:.*[?&](page=\d+))?)(?=(?:.*[?&](shelf=[^&]+))?)
  Redirect   : $1?per_page=100&sort=rating&order=d&view=covers&$2&$3
  Type       : Regular Expression
  ```
  ```
  Description: Goodreads "All Editions": Expanded details (language etc), 100 per page
  Example    : https://www.goodreads.com/work/editions/80128-silence-on-the-wire?expanded=false&utf8=✓&sort=num_ratings&filter_by_format=Nook
  Pattern    : (https://www\.goodreads\.com/work/editions/[^\?]*)\?*(.*)
  Redirect   : $1?expanded=true&$2&per_page=100
  Type       : Regular Expression
  ```
  All expressions takes inexact matches like "page" ∈ "per_page", randomly ordered or missing 
  parameters and Unicode values into account. Given duplicate query arguments, the last one applies.


## Discovering Non-Fiction Books
- checkout the bibliography section of a good book (best signal-to-noise ratio); I use a separate _"bibliogr-to-check"_ Goodreads shelf to keep track of unchecked books
- notice books mentioned in the _footnotes_ section of Wikipedia articles
- notice books mentioned in magazine articles
- notice names dropped in magazine articles and check them against Amazon
- scan interesting websites/blogs for books 
  - internal search or google for `book site:anygoodblog.com`
  - [HackerNewsBooks.com](https://hackernewsbooks.com/)
  - [top books on Reddit](http://booksreddit.com/)
  - [RedditFavorites.com](https://redditfavorites.com/books)
- search [books.google.com](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&q=specific+interest) for "specific interest"; try Google's [Talk to Books](https://books.google.com/talktobooks/) (since April 2018)
- search [Google scholar profiles](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&view_op=search_authors&mauthors=label%3A&btnG=) for `label:MY_AREA_OF_INTEREST` and check profile names against Amazon's book search
- [Google Alerts](https://www.google.com/alerts): "new book" + "specific interest"
- follow [Goodreads users](https://www.goodreads.com/user/18418712-andr/following) with interesting libraries
  - find Goodreads members [with similar taste](./likeminded.md) _(my GR toolbox)_
- investigate a list of [authors similar to the authors in your shelves](./similarauth.md) on Goodreads _(my GR toolbox)_
- inspect Goodreads books [common among members you follow](./friendrated.md) _(my GR toolbox)_
- check the Amazon and Goodreads profiles of users who comment good books
  - [get notified](https://andre-st.github.io/goodreads/) of new reviewers for your favourite books _(my GR toolbox)_
- follow small or specialized publishers through a [Twitter list](https://twitter.com/voidyll/lists/books), RSS-feed or newsletter (works so lala)
- reddit, quora, ...
- the better book sites:
  - [NewBooksNetwork.com](http://newbooksnetwork.com/)
  - [perlentaucher.de](https://www.perlentaucher.de/teaserliste/2_Buecher.html) (German)
  - [Hotlist](https://www.hotlist-online.com/) (German)
- recommendation engines hardly work for me: Goodreads never, Amazon sometimes
- [Bookstragram](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/bookstagram/) does not work for me
- [BookTube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BookTube) does not work for me, girls club & primarily fiction
- common bestseller lists do not work for me
- Parakweet's BookVibe closed in 2016, they sent you a list of books that your friends are talking about on Twitter
- ...
- get your keywords right: you have to know the right technical terms before learning about them; try "science books" or "textbook" over "nonfiction", all not necessarily scienctific or even academic but nonfiction is very broad; check non-english books too if you speak another language (no-brainer but st. I forgot)
- bookmark interesting titles now and inspect them later, books must arouse interest also after one month; I use multiple Amazon wishlists, which also show current 2nd hand prices, my comments and priorization; I have a separate "(lost interest)" wishlist as an alternative to deletion; my [Amazon Wishlist-Exporter](https://github.com/andre-st/amazon-wishlist) helps keep the overview by filtering ~60 wishlists by price and priority.
